In this article, I\u2019ll walk you through a Python script that efficiently handles data ingestion by reading files in chunks and inserting them into a PostgreSQL database.</p>\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>Data ingestion is a critical step in data analytics and machine learning workflows. Whether you\u2019re working with CSVs, Parquet files, or other formats, getting your data into a database quickly and efficiently is essential. This tutorial demonstrates how\u00a0to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read large datasets without overloading memory.</li>\n<li>Handle both CSV and Parquet file\u00a0formats.</li>\n<li>Insert data into a PostgreSQL database in\u00a0chunks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive into the solution!</p>\n<h3>What This Script\u00a0Does</h3>\n<p>The Python script automates the ingestion process with the following features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>File Format Support</strong>: Handles both CSV and Parquet\u00a0files.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Chunk-Based Processing</strong>: Reads data in chunks to avoid memory overload.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>PostgreSQL Integration</strong>: Leverages SQLAlchemy for database connections and insertions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Command-Line Arguments</strong>: Offers customization for database credentials, file path, chunk size, and\u00a0more.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Code Walkthrough</h3>\n<p>Below is the complete script with explanations for each key\u00a0section.</p>\n<h3>1. Parameter Parsing with\u00a0argparse</h3>\n<p>Using the argparse library, the script accepts user input via command-line arguments:</p>\n<pre>import argparse<br><br>parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Ingest data into PostgreSQL\")<br><br>parser.add_argument(\"--user\", help=\"Postgres username\", default=\"root\")<br>parser.add_argument(\"--host\", help=\"Database host\", default=\"localhost\")<br>parser.add_argument(\"--port\", help=\"Database port\", default=\"5432\")<br>parser.add_argument(\"--db\", help=\"Database name\", default=\"ny_taxi\")<br>parser.add_argument(\"--table\", help=\"Target table name\")<br>parser.add_argument(\"--url\", help=\"Path to the data file (CSV or Parquet)\")<br>parser.add_argument(\"--chunk\", help=\"Chunk size for processing\", default=10000, type=int)<br><br>args = parser.parse_args()</pre>\n<p>This approach allows flexibility, enabling users to adapt the script to various datasets and database configurations.</p>\n<h3>2. Reading the Data\u00a0File</h3>\n<p>The script identifies the file format (CSV or Parquet) and reads the data accordingly:</p>\n<pre>import pandas as pd<br><br>def read_data(url, chunksize):<br>    if url.endswith(\".csv\"):<br>        print(\"File type: CSV\")<br>        return pd.read_csv(url, iterator=True, chunksize=chunksize)<br>    elif url.endswith(\".parquet\"):<br>        print(\"File type: Parquet\")<br>        df = pd.read_parquet(url)<br>        return [df[i:i + chunksize] for i in range(0, df.shape[0], chunksize)]<br>    else:<br>        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported file type: \" + url)</pre>\n<h3>3. Inserting Data into PostgreSQL</h3>\n<p>Using SQLAlchemy, the script connects to PostgreSQL and inserts data in\u00a0chunks:</p>\n<pre>from sqlalchemy import create_engine<br>def insert_data(chunks, table, engine):<br>    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks, start=1):<br>        print(f\"Inserting batch {i}...\")<br>        chunk[\"tpep_pickup_datetime\"] = pd.to_datetime(chunk[\"tpep_pickup_datetime\"])<br>        chunk[\"tpep_dropoff_datetime\"] = pd.to_datetime(chunk[\"tpep_dropoff_datetime\"])<br>        chunk.to_sql(name=table, con=engine, if_exists=\"append\", index=False)</pre>\n<h3><strong>How to Use the\u00a0Script</strong></h3>\n<p>Follow these steps to use the\u00a0script:</p>\n<h4>1. Install Dependencies</h4>\n<p>Ensure you have the required libraries installed:</p>\n<pre>pip install pandas sqlalchemy psycopg2 pyarrow</pre>\n<h4>2. Save the\u00a0Script</h4>\n<p>Save the script as data_ingestion.py.</p>\n<h4>3. Run the\u00a0Script</h4>\n<p>Run the script with appropriate arguments. For\u00a0example:</p>\n<pre>python data_ingestion.py \\<br>    --user root \\<br>    --host localhost \\<br>    --db ny_taxi \\<br>    --table yellow_taxi_data \\<br>    --url path/to/your/file.csv \\<br>    --chunk 10000</pre>\n<p>When prompted, enter the password for your PostgreSQL user.</p>\n<h3>Pipeline Overview</h3>\n<p>Below is a visual representation of the pipeline for this ingestion process:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7nEXQbBq5YMfPI7Bq2qKug.png\"></figure><h3>Example Scenarios</h3>\n<p>Here are some scenarios where this script\u00a0shines:</p>\n<h4>1. Handling Large CSV\u00a0Files</h4>\n<p>When working with CSV files larger than your system\u2019s memory, the script processes and inserts data in manageable chunks.</p>\n<h4>2. Integrating Parquet\u00a0Files</h4>\n<p>Parquet files, known for their efficiency, are fully supported. The script reads the entire file and splits it into\u00a0chunks.</p>\n<h4>3. Preprocessing During Ingestion</h4>\n<p>You can modify the script to preprocess data (e.g., handling missing values or normalizing columns) during ingestion.</p>\n<h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>\n<h4>Challenge: Ingestion is slow for very large datasets.</h4>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Optimize PostgreSQL performance by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disabling indexes temporarily during insertion.</li>\n<li>Using bulk\u00a0inserts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Challenge: Unsupported file\u00a0formats.</h4>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Extend the script to handle formats like JSON or\u00a0XML.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This script provides a robust and scalable solution for ingesting large datasets into PostgreSQL. By leveraging Python\u2019s data processing capabilities and SQLAlchemy\u2019s database integration, you can handle files of any size with\u00a0ease.</p>\n<p>Feel free to adapt this script to your specific workflows.

It allowed us to maintain reproducibility, version control, and efficient artifact\u00a0storage.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\ud83d\udce6 MinIO (Secure Cloud Storage):</strong> MinIO, a high-performance object storage solution, was used to store datasets and model artifacts. Its S3 compatibility ensured secure and reliable access to\u00a0data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\ud83d\uddc2 PostgreSQL with pgAdmin (Metadata Repository):</strong> PostgreSQL was utilized as a metadata repository to manage structured data, while pgAdmin provided an intuitive interface for database management.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\ud83d\udc0b Docker Compose (Container Orchestration):</strong> All system components, including MLflow, MinIO, and PostgreSQL, were containerized using Docker Compose. This ensured simplified deployment and scalability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Deployment</strong></p>\n<p>To enable seamless communication between components, we utilized <strong>gRPC</strong>, a high-performance, open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework. The benefits included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\u26a1 Speed:</strong> gRPC ensured low-latency communication, critical for real-time ML predictions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\ud83d\udcc8 Scalability:</strong> Its efficient serialization (Protocol Buffers) allowed the service to handle large-scale deployments with\u00a0ease.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>This project taught us valuable lessons about integrating MLOps and cloud-native tools into real-world machine learning\u00a0systems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>MLOps Is Essential:</strong> Tools like MLflow and Docker Compose streamline the development and deployment lifecycle, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Security Matters:</strong> Using MinIO and environment variables enhanced the system\u2019s security and reliability.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Collaboration Wins:</strong> Combining expertise across data science, DevOps, and software engineering led to an efficient and innovative solution.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our water potability ML service exemplifies how integrating modern tools and frameworks can solve real-world problems efficiently. From experiment tracking to scalable deployment, the project demonstrates the power of MLOps in building impactful solutions.</p>\n<p>Explore the full implementation and architecture details on\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/Lab-ICN/water-potability-ml-service.git\"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s create a safer, more sustainable future together\u200a\u2014\u200aone drop at a\u00a0time.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e6b6287376fd\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["docker","mlops","enviromental-technology","machine-learning","data-science"]}]}
